SimpleJaxWsExample
==================

Simplest case example of using EE7 JAX-WS with an endpoint, accessed using a generated client and a proxy client.

This is not intended to illustrate all possible features of JAX-WS, only a simplest getting started example
of using annotations to define an endpoint, generating a client with wsimport, and creating a client at runtime with the 
Service.create() proxy approach.
